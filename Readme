Color Detection with OpenCV
This Python script uses the OpenCV library to perform color detection using a webcam. The user can input specific RGB values to detect and visualize in real-time. The script captures video from the webcam, converts the frames to the HSV color space, and applies a mask to identify the specified color range. The bounding box around the detected color is displayed, and the user can press 'q' to stop the program.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
OpenCV
PIL (Pillow)
Install the required libraries using:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python pillow

Usage
Run the script: python color_detection.py
Enter the RGB values when prompted.
The webcam feed will open, and the specified color will be highlighted with a bounding box.
Press 'q' to stop the script.
Customization
Feel free to customize the script according to your needs. You can modify the color detection algorithm, change the input method for RGB values, or add additional features.
